# pp-sandbox
Project ideas starting documentation and research.

## Structure of my GitHub
I will have various purposes of this account. Ranging from a record of my university work to personal project and paper reviews/interesting research areas. 

All projects will have a prefix (as shown below) which means they fall into the following catergories: 

Project Type  | Prefix
-------------: | :-------------
Personal project  | pp-
University  | uni-csXXX-
Interview prep  | intv-
Online courses/tutorials  | course-
Miscellaneous  | msc-


## Purpose 
This repo is to keep a record of the random ideas I have and minor documentation for said projects. When the ideas begin to take shape I will move them to their own repo with the prefix "pp-" to denote that they're a personal project.
